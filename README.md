# Particle_Life_2D

This was my first attempt to implement Particle Life based on [Tom Mohrs YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YirERTVF0&t=202s).

## Project Overview

| Personal Rating | Year of Development | Languages | Tools | Type of Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5) | 2022 | C++ | SFML | Simulation |

## Features
- 2D Particle Simulation
- setting options for attraction values, distances of interaction and speed via own GUI

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites and basic information

- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- This repo does not provide an executable -> you have to compile your own (I used Visual Studio)
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for C++ and SFML
- All dependencies are included in this repo, so it is almost plug and play :)

## Installation

1. Clone Repository
`git clone https://github.com/tp-codings/SFML_Particle_Life_2D.git`
2. Build Executable (e.g. Visual Studio)
